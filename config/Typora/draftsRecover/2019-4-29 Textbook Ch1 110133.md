### What Visualisations Should Do

- **Show** the data
- Induce the viewer to **think about the *substance*** of the IV, rather than about methodology or other details of the visualisation.
- **Avoid distorting** what the data have to say
- Present **many** numbers in a **small space**
- Make large data sets **coherent**
- Encourage the eye to **compare** different pieces of data
- Reveal the data at **several levels of detail**, from a broad overview to the fine structure
- Serve a reasonably **clear purpose**: description, exploration, tabulation, or decoration
- Be closely integrated w/ the **statistical and verbal descriptions** of a data set.
