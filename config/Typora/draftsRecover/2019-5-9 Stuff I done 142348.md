# Stuff I Gone and did for IVP

- To import the CSV file into a MySQL database

```shell
mysqlimport --ignore-lines=1 --fields-terminated-by=',' --fields-optionally-enclosed-by='"' --lines-terminated-by='\n' --local -u root SpotifyFeatures tracks.csv
```

- Seemed to work well, except the audio features have not been imported as decimals - they are binary values of either 0 or 1.
