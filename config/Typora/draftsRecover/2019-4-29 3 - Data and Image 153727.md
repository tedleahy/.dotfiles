###   Last Lecture - Values of Visualisations

#### 3 Key Values

1. **Record** information
   - Blueprints, photographs, seismographs
2. **Communicate** info to others
   - Share & persuade
   - Collaborate & revise
3. Analyse data to **support reasoning**
   - Find patterns/discover errors in data
   - Expand memory
   - Develop & assess hypotheses



#### Different Stages of Visualisation

### Today's Lecture

- How to **process** data?
  - Data models
  - Processing algorithms
- How to encode the data using **images** (the visual channel)?
  - Visual encoding (mapping)

## Data



### Data Models

- **Data Models** = Formal descriptions of data

- They characterise the data through 3 components:
  1. **Objects** (Items of interest)
     - Students, courses, semesters
     - Correspond to tables in a DB
  2. **Attributes** (properties of data)
     - Name, age, id, data, score
     - Correspond to columns in a DB table
  3. **Relations** (how 2 or more objects relate)
     - Students take courses, courses occur during semesters, etc.
     - Correspond to relations in a relational DB

  ![](img/example_data_table.png)
  
  - Each case (student 1, 2, 3, 4) represents one data point of a given object
  - The variables represent things about those data points you want to visualise

### Taxonomy of Data Types

- Different dimensions:
  - 1D  (sets & sequences)
  - 2D (maps)
  - 3D (shapes)
  - nD (relational)
- Temporal
- Trees (hierarchies)
- Networks (graphs)

### Nominal, Ordinal & Quantitative

- These are the **3 main types** of values for a variable of a given data point.

- **N - Nominal** (labels or categories)
  - e.g. math, art (course)
  - **Operations**: $=, \neq$
    - All you can do is check if 2 nominal data variables are equal or not

- **O - Ordered/Ordinal** (any ordered data - numbers, grades, etc.)

  - e.g. A, A-, B+, B (grade)

  - **Operations**: $=$, $\neq$, $<$, $>$

  - These are variables where the order matters but **not the difference between values**.

    E.g. ask patients to rate pain on a scale of 1 to 10. 7 > 5 > 3, but the difference between 3 & 5 may be different from the difference between 5 & 7; all that matters is the order.

- **Q1 - Quantitative - Interval** (arbitrary zero - difference between 2 arbitrary values)

  - e.g. (3.23, -1.2) (GPS)

  - **Operations**:  $=$, $\neq$, $<$, $>$, $-$

  - These are variables where the difference between two values is meaningful.

    E.g. the difference between 90° and 100° is the same as the difference between 90° and 80°.

- **Q2 - Quantitative - Ratio** (zero is fixed)

  - e.g. 20, 19, 22, 21 (age)

  - **Operations**:  $=$, $\neq$, $<$, $>$, $-$, $\%$

  - Will be encountered most

  - These are the same as interval variables, but with a **clear definition of zero**. When a data point equals zero, there is none of the variable there.

    E.g. °C is not a ratio variable, because 0°C does not mean no heat. But temperature in kelvin is a ratio variable, because 0° kelvin really does mean no heat.

  - With ratio variables, you can look at the ratio of 2 data points; e.g. a weight of 4g is double a weight of 2g, because weight is a ratio var, but temperature of 100°C is not double 50°C, because °C is not a ratio var.

### Dimensions and Measures

##### Dimensions (Independent variables)

- Discrete variables *describing data* (N, O)
- Categories, dates, binned quantities

##### Measures (Dependent variables)

- The data values that can be aggregated (Q)
- Numbers to be analysed
- Aggregate as sum, count, avg, std. deviation, etc.

### Exercises

![](img/exercise.png)

- Five variables here: **year**, **age**, **marst** (marital status), **sex**, **people**. For each one, say whether the variable is nominal, ordinal or quantitative, and whether it is a dimension or measure.

1. **Year**
   - **Q1 (interval)**
   - Measure
2. **Age**
   - **Q2 (ratio)**
   - Measure
3. **Marital Status**
   - **N**
   - Dimension
4. **Sex**
   - **N**
   - Dimension
5. **People**
   - **Q2 (ratio)**
   - Measure



### Data Processing

2 main things you need to do:

#### Data Cleaning and Filtering

- for quality control
- **Remove** things like accidental measurements or outliers & missing data (so that they don't bias the IV.)
- **Modify** data (e.g. conversion of format, such as from one date format to another)
- For solving problems with the data such as:
  - **Missing data**
    - e.g. no measurements, redacted measurements
  - **Erroneous values**
    - e.g. misspellings, outliers
  - **Type conversion**
    - e.g. zip code $\to$ lat and long
  - **Entity resolution**
    - Where you have different values for the same thing - e.g. USA, United States of America, US - all mean the same thing
  - **Data integration**
    - Errors when combining data

#### Data Adjustment

- Done after cleaning and filtering
- Depends on your task and then questions you want to ask the data
- Relational algebra:
  - E.g. **aggregation, mean, sort, projection**
- Reformatting and Integration

### Example - Rotten Tomatoes and IMDB

- Say you want to compare these 2 data sets to find out if there is a correlation between ratings of films on the two platforms.
- A bunch of the films on both platforms have a rating of null, especially on rotten tomatoes where there are loads of null ratings.
- So when you compare them in a scatter plot, you find that there is a correlation, but lots of data is missing because it might be null in one database but have an actual rating in the other.
- Also, when you plot ratings ratio against year of film release, you find that there are a number of ratings released after 2020, which doesn't make sense because those films haven't been released, so you know that this is some erroneous data.

### Data Cleaning and Filtering - Takeaway

- Exercise **scepticism** when looking at the data set
- Check data quality and your assumptions
- Start w/ **univariate summaries** (where you visualise just 1 var of interest first, making it easier to spot outliers, errors, etc.) then start to consider relationships among variables after you've cleaned the data for that variable.

### Data Adjustment: Relational Algebra

- Relational Data Model
- Data Transformations (SQL):
  - **Projection** (select) - selects certain columns, e.g. just name and age
  - **Selection** (where) - filters rows, e.g. stats from 1980 onwards
  - **Sorting** (order by)
  - **Aggregation** (group by, sum, min, max, ...)
  - **Combine relations** (union, join, ...)

## Image



### Image: Visual Language

- **Visual Language** is a **Sign System**
  - Images are perceived as a set of signs
  - Sender encodes information in signs
  - Receiver decodes information from signs

- 3 sign fields:
  - **Resemblance**
  - **Order**
  - **Proportion**

### Visual Encoding Variables

**Bertin's Semiology of Graphics (1967)**

![](img/bertin_semiology_of_graphics.png)

- These are all different ways you can visually encode different variables.

### Information in Hue and Value

- **Value** is normally perceived as ordered:

  - Encode ordinal variables (O) - you assume that as the color gets lighter, e.g. a value increases

  ![](img/encode_ordinal_vars.png)

  - Encode continuous variables (Q) (doesn't work quite as well)

    ![](img/encode_ordinal_vars2.png)

- **Hue** is normally perceived as unordered

  - Encode nominal variables (N) using color:
