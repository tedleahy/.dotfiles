# Stuff I Gone and did for IVP

- Goal is to display visualisations for different measures for github repos:
  - **<u>Commits</u>**
    - Number over time
    - Avg volume of code per commit
    - Avg length of commit message
    - Various language analyses on commit messages
    - Frequency based on time of day, e.g. num of commits for each repo at 9:00, 10:00, 11:00, etc.
  - **<u>Contributors</u>**
    - Number over time
    - Number of regular contributors (avg. 1/more commit per week) over time
    - Show location on map of both normal and active contributors, over time.
  - **<u>Languages</u>**
    - Proportions of all, how they've changed over time per repo
    - Proportions - how they compare repo by repo, over time
      - So here you'll see most common languages
    - Languages most commonly used together
      - single & all repos, show change over time
      - plot against size of project
        - size = num of regular contributors, lines of code, num of commits
  - **<u>Issues</u>**
    - Total num over time
      - single/all repos
    - Avg. issues opened per week - pie chart type thing (radar maybe?)
    - Issues per week shown over time
    - Issue lifetime (time from creation to deletion)
      - average, and over time.
      - plot against number of active contributors
    - Plot everything about issues against number of active contributors:
      - "Does having a large number of contributors lead to more bugs, due to less knowledge of the full codebase?"
      - "To what extend does having a large number of active contributors lead to quicker issue resolution"
        - "and how does the programming language used affect this"
    - Also plot everything against main language being used for that project
      - So might be good to get top/trending repos for each top language.
  - **<u>Forks</u>**
    - Num over time
    - Activity of forks (total volume of commits for all forks for a repo over time), to see which repos have the most active forks
  - **<u>Branches</u>**
    - Num over time
    - Could vi
