# Notes on Learning R

##### Such That

```r
> x[is.na(x)]
# All elements of x that are NA

> x[x > 0.3]
# All els of x greater than 0.3

> x[x > 0.3 & x < 2.4]
```



##### Access Vector Element(s) by Index

```r
# Just one element
x[2] # *one-based* indexing

# Elements at the following indexes
x[c(1,3,9,24)]
```



##### Elements of Vector Except Those at Given Index(es)

```r
> x[-1]
# All elements except the first one

> x[c(-2, -10)]
# All elements except the second and tenth one

# Equivalent:
> x[-c(2, 10)]
```



##### Convert Vector to Matrix

```r
> my_vector <- 1:20
# c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20)

> dim(my_vector) <- (4,5)
# Sets the dimensions of my_vector to 4 rows and 5 columns, meaning that it's now 2D

> class(my_vector)
# "matrix"

# #
# Better Alternative (one line):
# #
> matrix(data = 1:20, nrow = 4, ncol = 5)
```



##### Convert Matrix to Data Frame

- A data frame is a matrix, but with variables of different types. A matrix must be homogeneous.

```r
> my_data <- data.frame(my_matrix)
# Straight conversion

> my_data <- data.frame(my_vect, my_matrix)
# Creates a data frame, adding my_vect as the first column and my_matrix as the rest
```



##### Checking Two Data Structures are Equal

```r
# NOT like this:
> matrix1 == matrix2
# returns a matrix of same length, does el-wise equality checking

> identical(matrix1, matrix2)
# returns either TRUE or FALSE
```



##### Set Column Names of a Data Frame

```r
> colnames(my_df) <- c("Name", "Age", "Height")
```



##### `tapply`

Splits the data into groups, then calls a function on all of a given variable within each group.

```r
> tapply(flags$animate, flags$landmass, mean)
# Gets the mean of the flags containing animate objects within each landmass
# Here, animate is 0 or 1, so this gets the proportion of flags w/ animate objects in each landmass

> tapply(flags$population, flags$red, summary)
# Gets a summary of the population values for the two categories of countries: with red flag, without red flag

> tapply(flags$population, flags$landmass, summary)
# Gets a summary of the population values for flags in each landmass
```



##### How to understand a dataset

- Look at it and examine it.
- What is the format of the data?
- What are the dimensions?
- What are the variable names?
- How are the variables stored?
- Are there missing data?
- Are there any flaws in the data?

##### Examining a Dataset

E.g. for USDA plants dataset:

```r
# Get dimensions
> dim(plants)
[1] 5166 	10

# Rows and cols separately
> nrow(plants)
[1] 5166
> ncol(plants)
[1] 10

# Size in memory of an object
> object.size(plants)
686080 bytes

# Get all variable/column names
> names(plants)
 [1] "Scientific_Name"      "Duration"             "Active_Growth_Period"
 [4] "Foliage_Color"        "pH_Min"               "pH_Max"

 [10] "Temp_Min_F"      

# Count all the different observations and their frequencies for a variable
> table(plants$Active_Growth_Period)

                     15                     144                      10

### Random Numbers

##### Random Sample

```r
# Simulate rolling four six-sided dice:
> sample(1:6, 4, replace = TRUE)
# picks 4 items randomly from the vector 1:6
# With replacement - this means the number is replaced after being chosen, so the same number can be picked multiple times.
```



##### Random Sample with Fixed Probabilities

```r
# picks between 0 and 1 100 times, with the probability of getting 0 = 0.3, of getting 1 = 0.7
# Simulates flipping an unfair coin, where 0 = tails and 1 = heads, 100 times
> flips <- sample(c(0,1), 100, replace = TRUE, prob = c(0.3, 0.7))
> flips
 [1] 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 1
[46] 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1
[91] 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1

# Because 0 and 1 have been used, you can count the number of 1s (heads) using sum:
> sum(flips)
77
```



##### Shuffling

```r
> sample(LETTERS)
[1] "L" "Q" "V" "R" "J" "B" "C" "Z" "A" "X" "T" "E" "S" "K" "I" "Y" "N" "P" "U" "O" "W" "M" "D"
[24] "F" "G" "H"
```



##### Probability Distributions

- A table or equation that links each outcome of a statistical experiment w/ its probability of occurrence.

- E.g. flipping coin twice:

  | Number of heads | Probability |
  | --------------- | ----------- |
  | 0               | 0.25        |
  | 1               | 0.50        |
  | 2               | 0.25        |

- **Uniform Distribution**
  - Simplest - all of the values of a random var occur w/ equal probability. E.g. rolling a die.
- **Binomial Experiment**:
  - Statistical experiment consisting of $n$ repeated trials.
  - Each trial has 2 possible outcomes - success/failure
  - Probability of success, $p$, is the same on every trial
  - All trials are independent.
- **Binomial Probability**: the 



##### Binomial Distribution of a Random Sample

- **Binomial distribution** = probability distribution of the number of successes in a sequence of $n$ independent experiments

  - Each asking a yes-no question
  - With a binary outcome (0 or 1, True or False, Yes or No). 
  - Each positive/success outcome has a probability of $p$, and each negative/failure outcome has a probability of $q = (1 - p)$.

- You can easily get the random binomial distribution for something like the coin flip above in R:

  - The coin flip has a binary set of outcomes - heads (1) or tails (0), and a probability of success (heads) - $p = 0.7$.

  ```r
  # Random distr. where 1 observation is produced (n), 100 experiments are carried out (size) and the probability of success is 0.7
  > rbinom(n = 1, size = 100, prob = 0.7)
  68
  > rbinom(n = 1, size = 100, prob = 0.7)
  73
  
  # Switch so that 100 observations are produced, 1 experiment is done, same probability
  > rbinom(n = 100, size = 1, prob = 0.7)
   [1] 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 1
  [46] 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 1
  [91] 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
  ```
