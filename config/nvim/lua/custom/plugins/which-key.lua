-- note: plugins can also be configured to run lua code when they are loaded.
--
-- this is often very useful to both group configuration, as well as handle
-- lazy loading plugins that don't need to be loaded immediately at startup.
--
-- for example, in the following configuration, we use:
--  event = 'vimenter'
--
-- which loads which-key before all the ui elements are loaded. events can be
-- normal autocommands events (`:help autocmd-events`).
--
-- then, because we use the `config` key, the configuration only runs
-- after the plugin has been loaded:
--  config = function() ... end

return { -- Useful plugin to show you pending keybinds.
  'folke/which-key.nvim',
  event = 'VimEnter', -- Sets the loading event to 'VimEnter'
  config = function() -- This is the function that runs, AFTER loading
    require('which-key').setup()

    -- Document existing key chains
